# **Generative Fashion: Turtle-Printed Digital Runway**  
### *Python + Clo3D Project*  

---

##  Project Overview  
I’m creating a **digital fashion show** where some textile patterns are **generated using Python’s Turtle graphics** and applied to 3D garments in **Clo3D**. Instead of designing prints manually, I’ll code them—making each outfit’s texture unique. The final deliverable is a **short animated runway film** showcasing the collection.  

**Why?**  
- Combines my interest in coding + fashion design.  
- Explores generative art as a textile design tool.  
- Challenges traditional fashion workflows (hand-drawn → algorithmic).  


## Tools & Workflow  

### **1. Pattern Generation (Python)**  
- **Turtle Graphics** → Base patterns (geometric, organic, random).  
- **PIL/Pillow** → Post-process & export high-res textures.  
- **NumPy/Matplotlib** → For complex math-based designs (backup).  

### **2. 3D Garment Production (Clo3D)**  
- Model garments in **Clo3D**.  
- Apply generated textures as fabric prints.  
- Simulate fabric movement/draping.  

### **3. Animation & Rendering**  
- Animate runway walk + camera angles in **Clo3D**.  
- Render final video (may use Blender/Unreal for polish).  


## Some Challenges & Solutions 

| **Challenge**               | **Solution**                                  |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Low-res Turtle exports**  | Use `turtle.setup(4000,4000)` + SVG conversion. |
| **Seamless tiling**         | Test offset filters in Photoshop/GIMP.       |
